# Bookings-Plan-and-Goals-2024

The primary objective of our project was to significantly increase booking plans in the landscape care and maintenance industry, a sector with immense growth potential. We were fortunate to have access to a dataset graciously provided by our course professor, which served as a crucial resource for our analysis.

Our focus was on five essential products:

 • P1: Fertilization, Seeding, and Weed Plan
 
 • P2: Lawn Mowing and Maintenance Plan
 
 • P3: Mosquito Control Plan
 
 • P4: Tick Control Plan
 
 • P5: Tree and Shrub Service Plan

We also explored four creative marketing strategies:

 • C1: Direct Mail
 
 • C2: Door-to-Door Promotion
 
 • C3: Facebook/Instagram Paid Ads
 
 • C4: Google Ads

After analysing the data, we concluded that the most effective combination for increasing bookings was P2 - C2, which involves the Lawn Mowing and Maintenance Plan promoted through door-to-door outreach. This strategy yielded the highest conversion rate of 1.3%.

We also identified risk factors associated with our findings and provided recommendations for implementation to mitigate these risks.
